/**
 * Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's
 * about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur
 * algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
 *
 * The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image
 * in the following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of
 * the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels
 * on the border of x are then removed.
 *
 * Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
